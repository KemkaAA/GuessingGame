/*
You wake up at the middle of the night to an earthquake. You have moments to decide what to do (8 options) (3 correct options one option gets you injured)

Bad ending: Crushed by ruble, Injured(carries over to tsunami, )
After surviving you look at your phone to see a tsunami alert you need to decide what to do:
Bad ending stuck in traffic and submerged. (take the shortcut)
Stuck in a building and submerged. (take too long looking)
Die from injuries. (donâ€™t look for or use medical supplies after earthquake)

Good endings: Escape by car, Get to high ground in time

Flashlight(After earthquake) , phone (during earthquake) , car keys (during earthquake) , medical supplies(After earthquake)
